Cyberbullying represents the use of online 
platforms like social media, gaming platforms, and similar 
platforms to harass a person, hurt a person, or threaten a person. 
In this study, keyword filtering is introduced to enhance 
cyberbullying detection. Various machine learning models, 
including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support 
Vector Machine, as well as a deep learning model Convolutional 
Neural Network, are implemented on original and keyword
labelled datasets. The performance of these models is compared 
using various evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate that 
the performance of models on the keyword-labeled dataset is 
significantly higher, with Logistic Regression achieving 98.24%, 
Random Forest at 99.77%, SVM at 99.67%, and CNN at 99.95% 
accuracy. This study highlights the effectiveness of keyword 
filtering features in enhancing the detection of cyberbullying, 
providing a robust approach to creating safer online 
environments.
